# nvim
Nvim set up from scratch, one commit at a time

I created this repo because I was tired of not knowing how my vimrc worked. Now every line is documented with a choice.

## Common Settings I Left Out
- nobackup, nowritebackup, noswapfile :: backups for files covers the limitations of autowrite. I've yet to have a problem with swapfiles building up.

### On by Default (in Neovim at least)
- ruler
- showcmd
- incsearch
- laststatus=2
